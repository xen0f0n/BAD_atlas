                    <p class="text-justify text-white"><br>As the Artic is ravaged by climate change, the rich natural resources of the Arctic are expected to become increasingly accessible due to melting sea ice and thawing permafrost. In combination with the increasing accessibility, as natural resources are depleted elsewhere, there is increasing pressure on Arctic nations to further develop the Arctic. However, if the world is to stay on target to stay below 2 degrees of warming then it has been estimated that 80% of the worlds known fossil fuel reserves must stay unburned in the ground.<br><br></p>

We used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel 1 satellite to identify the location of persistent manmade objects in the ocean. We have compared this with known locations of offshore platforms in the Gulf coast and the North Sea. This is all implemented within a Google Earth Engine Application. In principle this could be scaled to map across the whole Arctic region and updated at regular intervals to provide an open dataset of oil rig locations.<br>Although we focused on oil platforms for this project, we were also interested in monitoring other forms of resource extraction such as illegal fishing. We believe that this could be achieved using a similar technique to our offshore oil platform detection algorithm. Ship detection is a well-studied field and ships can be seen readily using SAR data. While ships also typically use the Automated Identification System (AIS) to broadcast their location data, vessels engaged in illegal activities have been known to turn off their AIS transceivers. By identifying ‘ghost-vessels’ which appear using ship detection but are not broadcasting using AIS, we hope to give an indication of vessels which might be engaged in illegal fishing.<br>By incorporating these datasets in a visually appealing web-based platform we hope to be able to provide a service that will be informative to policy makers who may not intuitively realise &nbsp;the extent of resource extraction in the Arctic. The combination of automated algorithms and a user-friendly design will help our nations’ leaders understand encroachment of human activity on what should be a pristine Arctic environment we all want to protect.<br><br></p>
